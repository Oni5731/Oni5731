  Hi, I’m @Oni5731, French cybersecurity student.
  I’m currently studying pentestenting and cybersecurity engineering as an autodidact before launching my professional reconversion.
  If you want to help (tips, tools, how to, professional certificate, job, knowledge test, diploma) you can contact me :
